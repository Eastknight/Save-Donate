# Save-Donate

WHAT

We are building an application for both Android and iOS.
This application is for encourage online donation. 
We are trying to solve the following problem. 
1. There are a lot of orgnization looking for donation from public. But most people has no clue who are they and what are they doing.
2. People have low profit also want to donate to their favortie orgniazation. But they don't have much money. 

HOW

We will create a mobile application for encourage donation. 
How do we solve the problems I mentioned before? We are turn to company for help. We want some of them to provide coupon, and some of them are encouraged to post advertisement in our app.
So when user open the application. Here is the process:
1) chose coupon she/he want to use.
2) watch 10s-30s video advertisment or watch introduction to orgnization in same page.
3) get coupon and go shopping!
Then after user doing this, company who post video advertisement will pay donation to orgnization. 

At last,
orgnization: will get a huge amount of donation, great opportunity to introduce orgnization to public.
company: get loyal customers! an opportunity to post their advertisement
user: get coupon! Spiritual satisfaction.

Why

We are trying to create a win-win situation. 
For orgnization, they can get donation. And this is also an good oportunity to introduce themselve to public. Besides, we can anlysis the component of the donation(from people who buy BMW? or who buy McDonald's a lot) to see who are willing to support this orgnization, rich people? or middle class?
For company, this is a great platform to post their AD. First, target is more clear than other platform. And according to users' behaviour, we can choose the AD properly.
